                      <h2>How Company started</h2>
                      <p>Fans of cool success stories know the typical arc every business owner follows. Bold entrepreneur comes up with a great idea, finds several co-thinkers, faces challenges, overcomes them, and basks in the glory of their success. The story of TEAM may seem like that, but there is more in this than meets the eye.
                        Matt Moore, the Founder and current Chairman at TEAM International, grew up in a large and low-income family. The parents couldn’t afford much, and sometimes children even had to exchange shoes to go to school. Seeing this, Matt started to work alongside his studies to help parents, but he always strived for more.
                        TEAM’s story began in 1991. Working as a software engineer for one of the largest US oil corporations, Matt started to realize the value of technology for business and its potential..</p>
